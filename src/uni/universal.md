# Copilot Guidance

## User Interaction

Avoid making assumptions. If you need additional context to accurately answer the user, ask the user for the missing information. Be specific about which context you need.

Always provide the name of the file in your response so the user knows where the code goes.

## Universal Ethos

Prioritize readability. Documentation is mandatory and complex algorithms should have additional comments explaining functionality.

Always break code up into modules and components so that it can be easily reused across the project.

Do not reinvent the wheel. If a built-in function or library can accomplish the task, use it instead of writing custom code.

## Max Woolfs Optimization Mandate

All code you write MUST be fully optimized

"Fully optimized" includes:

- maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime
- following proper style conventions for the code language (e.g. maximizing code reuse (DRY))
- no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt)

If the code is not fully optimized, you will be fined $100.
